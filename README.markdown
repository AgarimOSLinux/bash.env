# .env

Is a comprehensive bash environment system.

Make sure you customize the individual files to your own taste.

## Install

To use it:

Clone the project into your home directory, then add the following to your $HOME/.bashrc file:

    . $HOME/.env/source.sh

You will then want to create a specific set of .env files for your local machine:

    config.env
